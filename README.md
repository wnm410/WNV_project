# Predicting West Nile Virus
This was a group project with Emma, Brian, and me.

After initial EDA, we split work. Emma cleaned and merged data sets to prepare for modeling. Brian worked on exploratory modeling, and I worked on the spatial data, creating a function to generate graphs. With the completed data, I worked on a pipeline with GridSearch to find the best model. Brian and Emma tweaked these models before landing on our best, which we submitted to Kaggle.
